MVC is an architectural design pattern that separates an application into three components: Model, View, Controller. My presentation details each design component, gives examples, and explains why MVC is so useful.

## Lessons Learned:

MVC is an incredible organizational tool. It makes it easier to traverse a new code base, something that can always be a little tricky! The clear separation of concerns accomadates not only the original writer of the code, but all who may need to make changes. Need to make a change to the User model of the application, look in the Models folder. Need to change the appearance of a user's profile page, check out the Views folder. Need to add new features (GET/POST/UPDATE/DELETE), then look at the Controller folder.
